## Accounting Tool: Reconciliation Helper 
When multiple individual bills are aggregated into bulk payments, tracking down a specific bill can become challenging. This could be neccessery if for example there is an issue with a bill then a need arises to provide proof of payment. This tool helps resolve such issues by identifying which individual bills contribute to a given bulk payment.

Using a subset sum algorithm, the program analyzes payment records to determine which specific amounts sum up to a given total. This can assist accountants and financial analysts in reconciling transactions.

Tech: HTML, CSS, JS, WASM, C++
