## 3D curve visualizer 
3D visualization tool to assist students learning math. In calculus there are problems such as "Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the given bounded region about the x-axis." This tool makes it possible to see what shapes will form when a curve is rotated around the y-axis.

* Bezier mode: Manipulate a curve using 4 points
* Equation mode: Input equations such as "y=x", "x^2", "sqrt(x)"

Tech: HTML, CSS, JS, p5.JS
